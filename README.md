[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)



## What you need

- A Kevo smart lock
- Kevo Plus bluetooth enabled gateway
- Reference : https://www.weiserlock.com/en/kevo/smart-lock
- Opt into the new Kevo login on mykevo.com
- A username on mykevo.com that has Admin eKeys to the locks you want to control

## Note

I have only tested this with Kwikset locks and it may not work with Baldwin or Weiser locks. If it does, please let me know!

## Kevo custom component setup

This component can be installed easily using HACS. The installation is handled via the UI, just add the integration by searching for `Kevo Plus`
